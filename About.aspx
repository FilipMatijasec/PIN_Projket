    <h3>Lego (/ˈlɛɡoʊ/ LEG-oh, Danish: [ˈle̝ːko];[1] stylized as LEGO) is a line of plastic construction toys that are manufactured by the Lego Group, a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark. Lego consists of variously colored interlocking plastic bricks made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene that accompany an array of gears, figurines called minifigures, and various other parts. Lego pieces can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct objects, including vehicles, buildings, and working robots. Anything constructed can be taken apart again, and the pieces reused to make new things.</h3>
    <h3>The Lego Group began manufacturing the interlocking toy bricks in 1949. Films, games competitions, and eight Legoland amusement parks have been developed under the brand. As of July 2015, 600 billion Lego parts had been produced</h3>
